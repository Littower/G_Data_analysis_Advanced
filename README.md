Scenario
Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a data professional working for Salifort Motors. 

Currently, there is a high rate of turnover among Salifort employees. (Note: In this context, turnover data includes both employees who choose to quit their job and employees who are let go). Salifort’s senior leadership team is concerned about how many employees are leaving the company. Salifort strives to create a corporate culture that supports employee success and professional development. Further, the high turnover rate is costly in the financial sense. Salifort makes a big investment in recruiting, training, and upskilling its employees. 

If Salifort could predict whether an employee will leave the company, and discover the reasons behind their departure, they could better understand the problem and develop a solution. 

As a first step, the leadership team asks Human Resources to survey a sample of employees to learn more about what might be driving turnover.  

Next, the leadership team asks you to analyze the survey data and come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. To help with this, they suggest you design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their job title, department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other relevant data points. A good model will help the company increase retention and job satisfaction for current employees, and save money and time training new employees. 

As a specialist in data analysis, the leadership team leaves it up to you to choose an approach for building the most effective model to predict employee departure. For example, you could build and evaluate a statistical model such as logistic regression. Or, you could build and evaluate machine learning models such as decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost. Or, you could choose to deploy both statistical and machine learning models. 

For any approach, you’ll need to analyze the key factors driving employee turnover, build an effective model, and share recommendations for next steps with the leadership team. 

Your Python notebook for this project includes a guided framework that will assist you with the required coding. Input the code and answer the questions in your Python notebook to build and evaluate a logistic regression model or the following machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, XGBoost. You’ll find helpful reminders for tasks like: 

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Model building and evaluation
